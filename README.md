# DocSearch
This project required me to create a program to search documents to find how many words are in the document and to find the relevat documents that contains the specified query. This project makes use of numpy.
To run this program, make sure that the docs.txt and the queries.txt files are in the same directory and pass those file names as command line arguments.
